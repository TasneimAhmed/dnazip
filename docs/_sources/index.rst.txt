Installation
************

- You can install the package either from pip or from the source code hosted on github_.

With pip
########

::

    pip install dnazip-bioinfo

From source
###########

::

    git clone https://github.com/dabane-ghassan/dnazip.git
    cd dnazip
    sudo python3 setup.py install


Getting started
***************

GUI
###

- After installing the package from source or using pip, the interface can be launched simply from the command line: ::

    dnazip

- If problems occur with the installation, an interface instance can be imported and launched: ::

    from dnazip.interface import Interface
    gui = Interface()
    gui.main()


Using the library
#################

Generating a random DNA sequence
--------------------------------

- A random DNA sequence with an alphabet of ATCGN can be generated for any given length specified in the parameter. ::

	from dnazip.sequence import Sequence
	randseq = Sequence.generate(length=5000)
	Sequence('/path/to/new/seq').write(randseq)

Encoding a DNA sequence with Burros-Wheeler + Huffman Coding
------------------------------------------------------------

- To encode a DNA sequence using BWT and Huffman coding, you can use a FullEncoder object that will save two files to the same directory as the sequence, the Burros-Wheeler transform and the UTF-8 zipped format of the sequence: :: 

	from dnazip.encoder import FullEncoder
	encode = FullEncoder('/home/ghassan/M1/gtf.txt')
	encode.full_zip()

- The attributes of the object can be accessed to see intermediary results: ::


	encode.bw_encoder.rotations # a matrix of string rotations from a sequence
	encode.bw_encoder.bwm # The Burros-Wheeler Matrix
	encode.bw_encoder.bwt # The Burros-Wheeler Transform

	encode.huff_encoder.header # The header of the zip file that contains Huffman codes for each character as well as the sequence binary padding
	encode.huff_encoder.binary # The binary sequence of the BW transform
	encode.huff_encoder.unicode # 8-bits encoded binary sequence

- ***A random sequence of size 1kB was compressed efficiently to 549 bytes.***


Decoding a DNA sequence with Huffman decoding + Reversing Burros-Wheeler transform
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- To decode a zipped DNA sequence using Huffman decoding and the inverse of BWT, you can use a FullDecoder object that will work in the same manner as the FullEncoder object: ::

	from dnazip.decoder import FullDecoder
	decode = FullDecoder('path/to/seq')
	decode.full_unzip()

- The attributes can also be accessed to see intermediary results: ::

	decode.huff_decoder.header # The header of the zip file that contains Huffman codes for each character as well as the sequence binary padding that where saved when the Huffman tree was created
	decode.huff_decoder.unicode # 8-bits encoded sequence
	decode.huff_decoder.binary # The binary sequence

	decode.bw_decoder.bwm # The Burros-Wheeler reconstructed matrix
	decode.bw_decoder.original # The original sequence

Building the Burros-Wheeler transform using the advanced algorithm
------------------------------------------------------------------

- The BWT can be constructed using a Suffix Array (SA) based algorithm that has a better time and space complexities: ::

	from dnazip.sequence import Sequence
	from dnazip.burros_wheeler import BurrosWheeler

	seq = Sequence('/home/ghassan/M1/gtf.txt').read()
	BurrosWheeler.bwt_advanced(seq)
