# [UNDER DEVELOPEMENT] This project is a part of the algorithms and data structures course in my master's degree and it's currently being worked on with the help of this [youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJOShNabSl-qsp5-D-WJe0Dk9nIE5aPC1) (((***because there's nothing better than projecting advanced data structures inside the cerebral cortex with some metal xD***)))

A Python implementation of The Burros-Wheeler Transform (BWT) alongside Huffman compression on DNA sequences.

## Workflow 
- **BWT** : Using Suffix arrays and LFP mappings (with B-ranks) to avoid na√Øve approches for the construction of the matrix and to improve time and space complexity.
- **Huffman** : Currently under developement.
- **GUI** : After finishing the two de/compression main steps.

## TODO 
- Implement a O(nlogn) for the array (maybe).
- Finishing reverse BWT.
- Factorizing BWT.
- Doing Huffman.
- Factorizing BWT and huffman.
- Thinking about filemanager methods.
- Creating a tkinter interface (or maybe another GUI framework in Python).
- Interfacing FileManager with the GUI.
- Linting and Doc on the go.

## Would be nice to implement
- Adding references to the README.
- Adding a CLI.
- Would be nice to use Cython.
- sphinx RTD.
- Maybe some benchmarking...
