- A Python implementation of ***The Burros-Wheeler Transform (BWT)*** alongside ***Huffman compression*** on DNA sequences.
- Hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dabane-ghassan/dnazip)
- Documentation? [**here**]()

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x 
- Tkinter

## Installation

- You can install the package either from pip or from the source code hosted on github.

### With pip

```bash
pip install dnazip
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dabane-ghassan/dnazip.git
cd dnazip
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

## Getting started

### GUI

### Do you want to use just the algorithms?

#### Generating a random DNA sequence

```python
from dnazip import sequence
randseq = sequence.Sequence.generate(length=5000)
sequence.Sequence('/path/to/new/seq').write(randseq)
```

#### Encoding a DNA sequence with Burros-Wheeler + Huffman Coding

```python
from dnazip import encoder
zip = encoder.FullEncoder('path/to/seq')
zip.full_zip()
```
